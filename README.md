# Statistical Inferences Course projects

###Course project Part 1

#### We investigate the exponential distribution in R and compare it with the Central Limit Theorem. 
#### The exponential distribution can be simulated in R with rexp(n, lambda) where lambda is the rate parameter. 
#### The mean of exponential distribution is 1/lambda and the standard deviation is also 1/lambda. Set lambda = 0.2 for all of the simulations.
#### We have investigate the distribution of averages of 40 exponentials. 

#### The Output inlcudes :
##### 1. The sample mean and compare it to the theoretical mean of the distribution.
##### 2. The variable of the sample is (via variance) and compare it to the theoretical variance of the distribution.
##### 3. The distribution is shown to be approximately normal.
